Code used to run the computational experiments to analyze the iterative solution in Section 5 is found in the notebook `Iteration_Linear.ipynb`. 

The file `delegation_utils` implements:
- a brute force algorithm for finding an optimal delegate,
- our efficient algorithm for finding an optimal delegate, and
- the iterative process described in Section 5.
